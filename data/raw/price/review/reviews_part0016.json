    "review": "Bought this years ago, so I can't be too hard on it. Lot of the classics in this package like asteroids, centipede ect. Definitely have the right idea having so many games on one emulator. Only issues I face is there isn't very clear directions on what keys do what. Trying to play the gravitron game for instance, it says press start to begin and there is no start button on the keyboard. Maybe if I had an atari controller this would be a simple fix, but I don't have one, so many of the games I'm unable to play sadly. Second issue is that I am playing this on my Tv connected to my computer, and when I press esc to go back to the main menu to play a different game, I get black screen that stays that way until I ctrl, alt, delete and end program. Not very fun to have to do that every time. Could be a resolution problem because of how big the tv is but I've had similar issues on my pc screen with this game as well. I hope the mods do a little updating to keep these great games alive. I'll have to see about getting a compatible atari pc controller for this so I can check out the other games. Thanks for the effort!",

Connecting talismans to restore power feels satisfying, and the pacing keeps things engaging without being overwhelming. The art and sound have that classic PopCap charm. If you enjoy relaxing puzzle games with a touch of Greek mythology, this one is definitely worth revisiting.",

    "review": "If you like Master of Orion II, this might be up your alley. Like MOOII it's turn-based space 4X game, complete with race customization options and ship design. There are mods that add additional ship sets and alien race pictures and gameplay changes. It's pretty easy to integrate these custom races from mods to the vanilla game too. Race customization includes various bonuses such as research, production and resources, right down to the demeanor or personality of the race (peaceful, warlike etc).\n\nLike all 4X games though, the late game (especially on large maps) can get very micromanagement-intensive. Although things such as being able to name fleets, orbital shipyards and individual ships at least helps identifying which of the 50 gazillion fleets is which (name a orbital shipyard as Planet A IV 1 or something for example). Being able to set waypoints/rally points for newly created ships to move to is nice too.\n\nWhile the graphics are IMO quite nice, they're decidedly retro which might not appeal to everyone. Those who can get past this will find a game with very high replayability value and customization for your role-playing needs.",

    "review": "There’s something deeply absorbing about diving into a turn-based 4X strategy game where the galaxy unfolds not in explosions, but in spreadsheets, diplomacy tables, and tech trees that go on for light-years. Space Empires IV Deluxe is a love letter to an era when complexity wasn’t a bug—it was the feature. It’s not a game for the faint of heart, but for those who enjoy managing empires with the finesse of a galactic accountant and the foresight of an admiral, it offers a unique blend of strategy that’s rarely matched even today.\n\nWhat It Does Well\nThe scope is nothing short of staggering. You don’t just pick a race and expand—you design it from the DNA up. Want a species that breathes methane and lives on molten rock? Go for it. You can customize ships down to individual systems, creating fleets that reflect not only strategic choices but personal playstyle. The freedom is intoxicating.\n\nThe tech tree is vast—so vast that your first dozen games will feel like tutorials. But once the rhythm kicks in, the discovery becomes part of the satisfaction. Finding obscure techs that shift your strategy or developing doomsday weapons that tip interstellar balance keeps each campaign fresh. Diplomacy, colonization, and warfare are all layered with complexity that rewards long-term planning over impulse decisions.\n\nMultiplayer, while a bit dated in terms of interface, adds a chess-like depth when played against equally obsessive opponents. Battles feel earned, not triggered by luck or rushed aggression. When you win in Space Empires IV Deluxe, it’s because you out-thought the enemy—not just out-gunned them.\n\nWhere It Stumbles\nLet’s get it out of the way: the interface is brutally outdated. The UI feels like it was lifted from a DOS-era spreadsheet program, and navigating menus is often a lesson in patience. Even with the Deluxe version, which irons out a few bugs and adds quality-of-life tweaks, there’s a persistent clunkiness that no patch has quite polished away.\n\nGraphics are purely functional, bordering on ugly by modern standards. If you need flash and flair to stay engaged, this won’t hold your gaze for long. The tactical battles, while satisfying in theory, play out more like detailed math problems than cinematic spectacles. You have to squint hard to find the drama.\n\nAI, though serviceable, often behaves in ways that break immersion—sending ships into suicide runs or making bizarre trade offers that feel more like random number generation than intelligent negotiation. And while modding can extend the game’s lifespan, setting it up can be an intimidating wall of text and folders.\n\nVerdict\nSpace Empires IV Deluxe is an acquired taste—but one that can be deeply rewarding for those who enjoy methodical planning over flashy execution. It's not a game that welcomes newcomers with a warm hug; it's more like being dropped into the control room of a star empire with a stack of unread manuals. But for those willing to embrace its depth, the payoff is immense. It's a strategy sandbox that lets you write your own spacefaring saga in excruciating—but satisfying—detail.\n\nPros:\n\nImmense customization of races and ships\n\nVast, complex tech tree with meaningful progression\n\nDeep strategic layers across diplomacy, colonization, and warfare\n\nHugely replayable with different strategies and setups\n\nSatisfying for long-term thinkers and micromanagers\n\nCons:\n\nOutdated UI and clunky interface\n\nPoor graphics and minimal visual feedback\n\nAI inconsistencies in both combat and diplomacy\n\nSteep learning curve with little in-game guidance\n\nTactical battles feel dry and overly abstract\n\nFinal Score: 7.5 / 10\n\nThis is not a polished blockbuster, but a dense and rich strategy gem buried beneath an avalanche of text and data. For the right kind of player, it's a galaxy worth ruling.\n\nIf you liked my attempt at making a professional review of this game, please leave a like for this review and if you think I should continue doing professional game reviews, then click on \"Award\" in the bottom right corner.

    "review": "quite possibly the greatest game of all time\n\nTbh I have great memories of playing this game as a kid, and it definitely helps improve typing. Unlike other typing games that can cause you to develop bad habits by looking at your hands, this game requires such fast responses that even if you are looking at your hands at first, you'll have to develop the muscle memory to avoid that if you want to stay alive in the game. \n\nThis game is still very fun and incredibly satisfying despite the dated graphics. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to improve their typing accuracy or speed.",
