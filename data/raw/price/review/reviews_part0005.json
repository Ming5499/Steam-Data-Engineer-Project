It was later made a standalone downloadable product with the release of Valve‚Äôs Steam storefront in September 2003. \n\nThe GoldSrc engine is heavily based on Quake's engine and includes recreations of Quake's weapons, maps, and items. It also includes some assets from the original Half-Life, such as the lambda symbol (replacing Quake's \"Q fork\" symbol), the crowbar weapon model (replacing Quake's handaxe), and numerous player models from Half-Life Deathmatch.\n\nThe game only contains its free-for-all deathmatch mode. A port of David \"Zoid\" Kirsch's popular capture-the-flag mod for Quake, \"ThreeWave CTF\" (or simply \"3wave\"), was planned, but ultimately abandoned, despite having new assets and maps created for it.\n\n[i]Fun fact: The cult-favourite Threewave CTF mod mentioned above has been added back into Quake after 27 years, and players can pick it up for free with the Steam remaster, alongside nine iconic CTF maps.[/i]",

    "review": "Twenty-two years after its release, Half-Life: Opposing Force remains a compelling expansion that successfully flips the script on the Black Mesa incident. Playing as Adrian Shepherd, a military operative initially sent to eliminate Gordon Freeman, you quickly discover that soldiers were just as much pawns in the conspiracy as the scientists they were ordered to silence.\r\n\r\nWhat Works\r\nSmart Role Reversal: The shift in perspective breathes new life into familiar environments. Watching Freeman make his iconic teleporter jump from the outside is a brilliant narrative touch that connects both stories seamlessly.\r\n\r\nExcellent Weapon Design: The new arsenal feels purposeful rather than gimmicky. The scoped pistol provides much-needed precision for distant headcrabs, while alien weapons like the face-hugging Shock Roach and the pet-like Spore Launcher add personality to combat. The barnacle grappling hook is particularly inspired, turning one of the original's most annoying enemies into a useful traversal tool.\r\n\r\nTeam-Based Combat: Fighting alongside AI squadmates adds tactical depth and makes narrative sense given your military background. Protecting teammates during key battles creates genuine tension beyond personal survival.\r\n\r\nVR Enhancement: The 2021 VR experience on Quest 2 transforms the game entirely. Weapon handling feels natural and immersive, making this the definitive way to experience Shepherd's story.\r\n\r\nWhat Doesn't\r\nFamiliar Frights: While the level design remains solid, the expansion leans heavily on the original's most tedious elements‚Äîexcessive jumping puzzles, box-pushing, and awkward rope swinging sequences that feel even more dated today.\r\n\r\nLimited Surprises: New enemies like shock troopers and pit drones are well-designed but few in number. The expansion plays things safe, rarely venturing into truly unknown territory.\r\n\r\nThe Verdict\r\nOpposing Force succeeds as both a nostalgic return to Black Mesa and a meaningful expansion of Half-Life lore. While it can't recapture the original's sense of discovery, it offers enough fresh content and perspective to justify the journey. For series fans, especially those with VR capability, it's essential. For newcomers, it's a solid introduction that benefits from more experienced hands holding the weapons.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy runs deeper than anyone imagined‚Äîand it's worth uncovering, even two decades later.",

    "review": "A Masterclass in Expansion: Half-Life: Opposing Force is a Perfect Sequel\r\nIn the pantheon of first-person shooters, few games hold a place as revered as the original Half-Life. Its blend of action, environmental storytelling, and unbroken narrative was revolutionary. So when Gearbox Software was tasked with creating an expansion, the pressure was immense. The result, Half-Life: Opposing Force, is nothing short of a masterpiece‚Äîa shining example of how to build upon an iconic foundation while simultaneously blazing a new path. It‚Äôs a standalone addition that doesn't just ride on the coattails of the original; it carves out its own legendary status.\r\n\r\nThe genius of Opposing Force lies in its radical shift in perspective. Instead of reliving the Black Mesa incident through the eyes of the silent scientist Gordon Freeman, we experience it as Corporal Adrian Shephard, a combat-trained marine sent in to \"clean up\" the mess. This narrative pivot is brilliant, turning the familiar environment of Black Mesa into a terrifying, alien-infested labyrinth from the other side of the conflict. The new perspective is invigorating, revealing that Shephard's mission quickly devolves from simple search-and-destroy to a desperate fight for survival, paralleling Freeman's own journey in the most captivating ways.\r\n\r\nWhat truly makes Opposing Force feel so fresh is its arsenal of new toys. The game introduces a fantastic array of weaponry that is both satisfying and incredibly fun to use. From the razor-sharp secondary fire of the Barnacle to the explosive power of the M249 SAW, each weapon feels distinct and purposeful. The addition of the Displacer, which teleports you to new locations, and the Shock Roach, a living organism that doubles as a weapon, showcases a level of creative design that expands the gameplay without betraying the franchise‚Äôs core mechanics. This inventiveness also extends to the enemies, with the fearsome Black Ops assassins and the grotesque Shock Troopers providing new, heart-pounding challenges that demand new strategies.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, Opposing Force hits the nail right on the head because it stays true to the original feel of the franchise. The oppressive atmosphere, the seamless, uninterrupted narrative, and the clever, puzzle-like level design are all here. The game's level design is particularly noteworthy, masterfully intertwining Shephard's path with Freeman's, offering glimpses of key events from a new angle. Seeing the G-Man watching you, or running past the very train car Gordon Freeman rode, creates a powerful sense of connection and deepens the lore in a way that feels both organic and incredibly satisfying. For a fan of the original, these creative ties are a joy to discover. Opposing Force feels like a loving tribute that was crafted by a team with a deep respect for its source material. It captures the essence of what made the original so special while providing enough new content to make it a must-play in its own right.",

Your moves also persist even though you didn't match anything. Creates some pretty fun gameplay. Also, the atmosphere in this game is great, they really nailed the space theme in this. Music is also best in the series here.\n\nIf you haven't tried it yet, give it a shot.",

No duden en comprarlo y disfrutarlo ya que con el paso del tiempo lo hace mas y mejor en todos los sentidos de la palabra.,Ahora para todos los que experimentan problemas al iniciar el juego en sistemas actuales solo deben seguir unos pasos sencillos para que funcione: Desde Steam van a Administrar-Ver archivos locales a continuaci√≥n click derecho sobre Bejeweled twist luego propiedades seguido dan click en Compatibilidad y para finalizar marcan donde dice (Ejecutar con una resoluci√≥n de pantalla de 640 x 480) Dan en Aplicar y Aceptar luego de esto ingresan al juego y funcionara perfectamente.De esta forma funciona en sistemas actuales donde no se ejecutaba y se abr√≠a una peque√±a ventana por un segundo que dejaba al juego roto.,Ahora si bien se vera con una menor resoluci√≥n el juego se podr√° disfrutar como en sus inicios y hacerlo un juego eterno como son todos los juegos de PopCap en mi humilde opini√≥n:)",
