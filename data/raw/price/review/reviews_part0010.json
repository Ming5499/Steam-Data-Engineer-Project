    "review": "I think this is one of the most underrated games in X series. \n\nThere is some bugs in original game (which was an actual reason for most of bad reviews) and some gameplay issues, but all of them could be fixed with a help of mods (there is hundreds if them). \n\nThis game has less \"sandbox\" in it compared to other games in this series. But on the other hand:\n - complete story line (the thing X4:Foundations lacks almost completely)\n - the best visuals in entire series (again X4:Foundations doesn't even close to this \"cosmic cyberpunk cities\" stations feel)\n - amazing music \n - more variance in gameplay\n\nSo in the end I would be extremely happy if the next game in this series will be something \"X4 sandbox meets XRebirth atmosphere\"",

    "review": "On parle souvent de X Rebirth comme d’un échec. Un projet trop ambitieux, mal lancé, mal reçu. Et c’est vrai que sa sortie, en 2013, a laissé des traces : bugs omniprésents, IA erratique, interface confuse, mécaniques incomplètes. Mais juger Rebirth uniquement à l’aune de son lancement, c’est passer à côté d’un jeu qui, avec le recul, incarne une tentative rare de réinventer le space opera à la première personne, dans un univers entièrement dynamique.\r\n\r\nX Rebirth n’est pas une suite directe de X3. C’est une réécriture. Un soft reboot. Nouveau moteur, nouvelle approche, nouvelle philosophie. Exit la liberté immédiate de piloter tout type de vaisseau : ici, vous êtes à bord du Skunk, un cargo unique que vous allez moduler, améliorer, personnaliser… et dans lequel vous allez passer des dizaines d’heures. Ce choix, radical, a été violemment critiqué à l’époque. Pourtant, il offre quelque chose d’inédit : une sensation de pilotage incarné, proche du cockpit de Battlestar Galactica ou Firefly. On vit vraiment à bord. On y reçoit les transmissions, les rapports, les alertes. On y embarque des copilotes. On s’y attache.\r\n\r\nLa direction artistique mérite d’être saluée. Stations monumentales, architecture industrielle alien, trafic constant dans les couloirs spatiaux, reflets sur la verrière du cockpit : tout respire la science-fiction « lourde », fonctionnelle, dense. Ce n’est pas une beauté propre et glacée à la Star Citizen mais une esthétique rouillée, vivante, crédible, plus proche de The Expanse. Et en 2025, après toutes les mises à jour, le jeu reste étonnamment beau, stable, et fluide sur une machine moderne.\r\n\r\nSur le plan de la simulation, Rebirth a toujours été ambitieux : économie dynamique, factions indépendantes, commerce libre, batailles à grande échelle. Le problème, à sa sortie, c’est que la moitié ne fonctionnait pas. Aujourd’hui, grâce aux patchs, au DLC The Teladi Outpost, à Home of Light, puis à The Expansion Pack, les systèmes sont réparés et exploitables. Vous pouvez construire vos stations, automatiser vos routes commerciales, recruter des équipages, installer des tourelles, concevoir votre propre flotte. C’est plus rigide que dans X4, certes. Moins modulaire. Mais ça fonctionne. Et surtout, l’immersion est intacte.\r\n\r\nLe gameplay intérieur – marcher dans les stations, parler aux PNJ, recruter un pilote ou un ingénieur est l’un des éléments les plus polarisants. À l’époque, c’était vide, lent, mal doublé. Aujourd’hui encore, ces séquences manquent de densité, mais elles restent une belle tentative de “mettre un visage sur le monde”. On peut regretter leur exécution, mais pas leur intention.\r\n\r\nX Rebirth reste un jeu systémique, mais plus guidé que ses prédécesseurs. La campagne principale (plutôt oubliable dans son écriture) sert surtout de long tutoriel. Le vrai plaisir vient du free roam, comme toujours chez Egosoft : explorer, commercer, construire, modifier l’univers en silence, sans cinématique, sans générique. C’est un jeu où l’on apprend plus dans l’ombre que dans la lumière. Et c’est ce qui le rend passionnant pour les amateurs de sandbox spatiaux.\r\n\r\nIl faut accepter ses défauts : interface peu intuitive, ergonomie parfois rigide, mécaniques plus rigides que dans X3 ou X4, impossibilité de piloter plusieurs vaisseaux (hors modding), et dialogues très inégaux. Mais il faut aussi reconnaître ce qu’il a été : un laboratoire de design. Sans Rebirth, X4: Foundations n’existerait pas tel qu’il est. C’est ici qu’Egosoft a testé les cockpits en vue FPS, les intérieurs de stations, le moteur Vulkan, la navigation modulaire, et la transition sans chargement entre espace et structures.\r\n\r\nEt pour le joueur qui sait lire entre les lignes, Rebirth est un objet fascinant. Moins abouti, oui. Moins libre, oui. Mais plus dense, plus immersif, et par moments… plus audacieux.",

    "review": "Things I found unenjoyable so far:\n\nFOV is bad. A mod fixes the cockpit view but doesn't affect first person mode.\nUI fonts and HUD do not scale to 4K. HUD scales with a mod.\nYou can't see NPC skills before hiring them - who thought that was a good idea??? Mod fix available.\nAccidentally falling out of highways due to mouse flight\nShip stops dead if you open a menu. So don't use menus I guess?\nHaving to press enter to open the menu\nFreighter won't follow you (100 energy cells mission)\nMouse flight is always enabled when you go back into your ship\nLeaving highways and being thrown inside station geometry with no way out\nFalling through the floor in first person mode\nPlot missions starting in the middle of my courier missions (jump gate)\nTargeting is automatic and this sucks. It's unlike any other space game\nBooster depletes shield. Which means if you're struggling in combat you can't run away (WTF!)\nWhen you speak to somebody a big orange circle covers their face. \nYou can be unable to move in first person mode after docking [bug]\n\nLet me get this straight you can go on stations and hire crew from the bar but you can't view or accept missions from the bar? Bruh what. That's the complete opposite from all space trading games, ever. \n\nI see where they were trying to go with this: making an immersive first person adventure with emotional bonding to your ship and crew like an RPG. Something other X games don't do. It's a little beyond their ability since station interiors and crew are all ugly and generic - even by the standards of 2013. \n\nPro for beautiful soundtrack though. \n\nI'll say one thing: modding saved this.",

    "review": "I had mostly skipped this game and moved after hundreds of hours in X3 to playing hundreds of hours in X4. But when Home of Light DLC was on on sale, I bought it and decided to revisit X:Rebirth. That was quite a good decision. X:R feels minimalistic and almost retro compared to X4, but it really enjoy playing a more low paced game for a change. And the visuals in X:R are just beautiful. So if you are playing one of the other X games already, probably X4, I can recommend adding some extra hours in X:R because it's really something different, yet familiar if you know what I mean.",

    "review": "This game really just feels like an inferior version of the Amazing Adventures games, also developed by SpinTop and published by PopCap. You have a certain number of levels, each consisting of a few different hidden object puzzles in different locations that relate to a relatively thin plotline. But this game does it worse.\n\nFor one thing, the AA games have a timer that is shared across every puzzle within each level. In those games, the timer pauses when you're on the map to choose a hidden object puzzle, but in this game, the timer continues counting down while on the map, which adds unnecessary stress.\n\nSecond of all, after completing each level of an AA game, you have to do a unique puzzle, such as memory match puzzles, word search puzzles, rotating tile puzzles, and more. I've beaten two levels of this game, and both of them ended with memory match puzzles. Not only that, but both puzzles had 6 x 6 grids, which seems like too much for just the first two levels in my opinion. I don't really want to keep playing and find out if every single level has a 6 x 6 memory match game.\n\nAlso, the images in this game are grainier and more pixellated than the ones in the AA games, which makes finding the objects just a little bit harder.\n\nFinally, I wanna talk about the story of this particular game. How the heck did this old lady lose her lottery ticket? I know that the Amazing Adventures games don't have characters onscreen, but I feel like a series about being a PI should allow for unique character interactions, which this game is sorely lacking so far. There should be some sort of villain or culprit who stole the ticket, and the player has to track them down. There should be witnesses who the player talks to in between levels. This story feels like such a wasted opportunity.\n\nIf you want to play a fun hidden objects game, I recommend one of the Amazing Adventures games, which you can also find on Steam. They're not exactly the most mindblowing or revolutionary games you'll ever play, but they're still more polished and enjoyable than this,",

This HOG (hidden objects game; for those who don't know) is one of the earlier ones. You will be going from location to location finding objects that the sidebar says to look for. There are also keys, which can be found to unlock the ENDLESS mode. Now, this game isn't without its challenge. Some objects may not be entirely obvious, as towards the endgame I was struggling to find at least 3 objects while on the clock. Thank goodness I managed to find those (I may have used hints, please don't judge) because some were not extremely obvious. Regardless, those seeking an older HOG from Popcap won't be disappointed!",
