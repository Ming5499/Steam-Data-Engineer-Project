For a lot of people, this game might just feel [i]old[/i]. But what's fascinating to me is that it felt old when it was released: it exudes nostalgia for previous eras of video games. [u]Iggle Pop Deluxe[/u] successfully evokes the feeling of playing a shareware game from 1992, from the tiny sprites to the keyboard controls to the weird font used for the text. At the same time, the gameplay is even older: you're playing a combination of [u]Snake Byte[/u] (1982) and Pac-Man (1980). It's a brilliant blending of the two games.",

    "review": "Heavy Weapon Deluxe to gra, która przenosi mnie do czasów, gdy rozgrywka miała być prosta, dynamiczna i przede wszystkim dawać masę frajdy – i dokładnie to robi. Wcielając się w pilota ciężko uzbrojonego czołgu atomowego, ruszamy przez kolejne poziomy, siejąc zniszczenie, unikając dziesiątek pocisków i eliminując setki wrogów w klasycznym, zręcznościowym stylu. Grafika ma swój urok – kolorowa, komiksowa, z humorem i klimatem retro. Muzyka i efekty dźwiękowe świetnie oddają atmosferę starej szkoły arcade. Nie ma tu zbędnych dialogów ani skomplikowanej fabuły – tylko czysta akcja i eksplozje od początku do końca.",

During gameplay you can build and choose from multitude of weapons. Movement is done by selecting your destination after that your spaceship cannot move until it restores energy. You can fire weapons anytime though. Gameplay might feel a bit confusing at first, big amount of weapons with complex description. Two different modes to choose from deatchmatch and objectives, where you're assigned with various missions like defend control station. You can transform your ship into rail, guard, repair or caliber form each giving you different bonus stats. You can change velocity and trajectory of your projectiles so they can fly behind corners. Music is decent. Visually looks ok, however space setting is not that great. Very specific game, with complex gameplay. Can't recommend it though unless you're a fan of strategy games with action elements and pvp fighting model.\n[/h1]",

    "review": "[i]TL;DR: Excellent game for its unique and exciting gameplay mechanics. Very much ahead of its time. There is a high skill ceiling and a large variety of weapons and ways to use them. Unfortunately it is basically multiplayer only and the online community is comatose. Don't buy unless you plan to play with friends or have plans to create a community.[/i]\n\n\nThis is the first game I ever bought on Steam and I had a blast with it. Would I recommend it? Only if you are going to play it with a group of friends or manage to get a community of players going because the real fun is in the multiplayer. Read on below for more.\nSIdenote: I played this game for far longer than 2 hours, the Steam data is mistaken. Don't ask me why, not the first time I've seen this happen.\n\n\nThreadspace: Hyperbol is one of those unique games that you think about from time to time and remember the good times you've had. Followed by the thought that perhaps it could be revived. The game's premise is that you are a member of one of three factions, controlling a ship and fighting for territory.\n\n\nThat may not sound like much, but the gameplay mechanics is where this game really shines. Even back when it was released it was a really fresh take on the tactical action genre and even to this day I have come across very few games that can match Threadspace for its skill ceiling and unique concept. All things considered it is very well thought out and plays smoothly in multiplayer.\n\n\nThe soundtrack is decent enough, and the visuals are somewhat outdated by this point, but it's not off-putting at all.\n\n\nThe only downside to this wonderful game is that the community is kinda non-existent. If you want to try it out, please get together with a few friends. I sincerely hope the game gets a reboot at some point.",

    "review": "This is really an awesome game that is quite fun however it has one major problem ..... it is a multi-player game that  is rarely played anymore.   You can play the game single player with AI bots (which are quite challenging if set to be so) or on LAN if you have seperate keys handy. \n\n[b]compatibility[/b]\nplays on windows 7 & 10  just fine.  I have not tested it on win8 systems\n\n[b]bugs[/b]\nNone. The game is not only polished, but has no bugs. \n\n[b]fun/replay value[/b]\nGood.\n\n[b]Multi-Player[/b]\nYes.\n\n[b]conclusion[/b]\nOne of the hardest things about the game is finding other players to play with.  Other than that it is a solid game (be sure and go through the tutorial - Did I mention it has a tutorial ? )",

Overall, however, the gameplay isn't that much fun, and the multiplayer scene is dead.\n\n$10 is far too much to ask for a multiplayer game with no players.  Cannot recommend.",

I WANT THAT ITEM SOOOOOOOOOOOO BADLY!! but i don't want to change factions. COME ON!! Rally behind me! WE GOTTA DO TIS'!!\nEach game you feel as this is the moment this is the game if you win this, if you just do this one thing, your faction will conquer the land and everyone will reap the rewards! Ppl will remember you as the one who just pushed the bar that one time and will silently pray that you just jump in again as a true member of theire faction.\n\n(too bad you couldn't completly win ever :P but that might, just might change :D)",
