Minimalist hacker-vibe meets artsy screensaver. The music? Synthy goodness that’ll make you want to hug a floppy disk.\r\n\r\nGameplay is part strategy, part action, part “wait... what am I doing?” But somehow, it all clicks. Watching your little Darwinian dudes evolve and fight back against viruses is weirdly satisfying.\r\n\r\n✅ Unique concept\r\n✅ Retro aesthetic with modern soul\r\n✅ Surprisingly emotional for a game full of green stickmen\r\n❌ No real reason not to try it unless you hate fun\r\n\r\nFinal verdict: 10/10 would spiritually adopt digital stickmen again.",

    "review": "Don't let my hours deceive you, I purchased the physical copy of this game from a Big Lots bin nearly 20 years ago. I have the keychain to prove it!!!\n\nIt's a phenomenal game. Sure, it is pretty simple, but you should know you're not buying a command heavy-RTS or colony sim when you buy this. The negative reviews on here are likely from purchasers that did not know what they are buying. This game is a vibe. It oozes digital atmosphere, like a song from Daft Punk, the Buggle's \"The Age of Plastic\" or Neil Young's \"Trans\" come to life. The story is incredibly told, but does not bog you down in text or cinematics. It establishes an emotional connection to the little green Darwinians so well that I felt sick to my stomach any time a misfortune would befall a densely packed cluster. It's a beautiful game, and I couldn't recommend it more.",

    "review": "[h1]Timeless Gem[/h1]\n[hr][/hr][i]Game remains an unique gem to this day. There are very few games which tries to portray a feeling of being in a virtual world. It retains an unique aesthetic and feeling. One which was very impressive back then and still holds up to this day. It is a timeless game, but these days and in the future we are cby a mediocre slop.[/i][hr][/hr]\n[h1]☠️It should be the sin to be poor☠️[/h1]\nI remember seeing this game in a gaming magazine. It struck me as such an unique and good looking game. Back then, games were trying to push 3D graphics into realism, but they were still looking quite unrealistic. Especially real time strategy games. This would put them in an uncanny valley or just make them look bad. Very few games looked graphically great in that period and AAA games were ones pushing the limits. This game stood out, because it was trying to do its own thing. It is an unique, little gem which is still great today. I only regret that I couldn't play it back then when I was a child. It would had blown me away as it would immerse me in a simulated, virtual world. I do regret of not being able to play it back then when games were a lot worse, far fewer and anything remotely good was an instant cult classic. This is one game which plays just as well today as it would had back then and it would had left much greater impression on me in those simpler times. Sadly, affordability was the main issue and childish lack of attention was another reason holding me back.\n\n[h1]💖What makes it special💖[/h1]\nGame tries to sell you an idea that you are in virtual world which is alive. Over time, this idea grows on you as game is immersive. It knows what it needs to do in order to try and sell you an idea of a world. It is not trying to be convenient or responsive. It doesn't reduce people in a game into HP and units. This inherent resistance helps you to feel that this is its own world rather than just a level which you have to conquer. Units which you control are explicitly stated to be just programs. They are directly controlled by you and are perfectly obedient. While Darwinians (local sentient inhabitants) on the other hand cannot be directly controlled. This separation goes a long way of making you believe that these two things are different and it helps with immersion. \n\nAnother aspect of an immersion is simulation. World is simulated from Darwinians to terrain or projectiles. Even entire game map tries to portray that it is something in which Darwinians live and work in and everything is connected. Over time, it grows on you through little experiences. It plays badly, but that serves to reinforce that it is not a video game. Simulation also goes a long way. Each particle has to connect with the enemy. Grenades bounce through terrain. You start thinking in terms of line of sight and high ground. You become more engaged with the map terrain and as result, you get emotionally invested with maps themselves. Sound of difficult battle going on in the distance and your Dawrinians lollygagging at the helps to sell you this world. Likewise, you can draft them and send them to die in the war. Seeing them trying to hold on positions which they are slowly losing is a missing ingredient which so many RTS fail to give to you. In those games, map and NPCs feel lifeless where here they have their own charm as they are simulated and reacting to threats which are themselves unscripted. This naturally leads into stories and far more natural situations.\n\n[h1]📋Stories from the front📋[/h1]\nI tried to establish Darwinian colony on an island, but couldn't because other 3 colonies would constantly launch raids upon me. I couldn't control my AI units fast enough to respond to two flank assault. Their main strength - perfect obedience was turned into their weakness. So, I started capturing another, starter island so to speak. I managed to establish my colony there. It was far easier cleaning spawn point after spawn point since they were separated by greater distances and were more linear to each other. So, I had time to capture souls and convert it to my population. After conquering, I then could push into that island through transfer point. With ability to rally Darwinians to my side, I managed to make them entrenched on that spawn point. Through greater initial numbers and by carrying turrets to fortify area, I could focus just clearing one spawn point after another. \n\nGame often turns into a siege warfare where you cannot just use your own directly controlled units. You have to rely on Darwinians who are semi-independent. This is what gives game so much of its charm. It is one thing to see your units fighting, it is another to see local inhabitants trying their best to fight. There was a spider infestation which I couldn't clear myself as they were spawning way too quickly and it would be massive chore to do it solo. So, I had called up Darwinians and established turrets at the entrance. They started to thin the never ending swarm. Each side dragging fallen entities as souls back to the base for revival unto their side. It is trench warfare to the extreme. Then I made several more formations and ordered them to engage spiders from another angle. They went through their mountain chain and occupied at that time, relatively free high ground with my soldiers. My soldiers were shock troops which cleared landing territory and kept enemies at bay until my allies arrived with their transport tanks. They established upon high ground and they started to seriously thin down the enemy horde from two sides. This was the thing which I was looking for since now I could easily use my troops/programs to go in and take their nests out. Once I had broken their numbers, rest was just the cleaning operation.\n\n[h1]🔧Where it falls short🔧[/h1]\nThis game had a surprisingly long support history. It is clearly loved and is taken proper care of. However, not all is roses and rainbows. I had issues with making Steam screenshots for the game. Steam integration could be better.\n\nMore substantial issue is that this game is simply dated. It is a game made in few years by few dudes more or less. Production values as such are low. Its unique artstyle can hide lack of graphical budget to make graphics, maps or music. However, it still has very little content. Enemies are very few and you will see most of them quite soon in the campaign. You have like one troop and one Darwinian troop. Rest are support units or gear. Enemies likewise are just 3 types. Regular lines on a ground, flying worm or a spider. Then there are recoloured Darwinians who are now evil and are fighting you. \n\nThen you start playing game, it can get tedious very fast. As you don't have unlocks and are not invested into the world, seeing a new map with multiple islands which are teeming with enemies, get old really fast. You need to manually kill each of those enemies and gather their souls for your Darwinias. Gameplay is slow and lacks in any variety. You sure have to get immersed and like what you are playing, otherwise you will be bored to tears.\n\n[h1]An Unique Experiment[/h1]\n[hr][/hr][i]I do wish that I could had played this game when I saw it in gaming magazine. Back then it would had struck like a truck. Its aesthetics would offer relief from mud, grey graphics at that time, awkwardly pushing for photo realism. It would be its own indie game when indie games didn't existed. Its mechanics would be seen as cutting edge and lack of content and its tedious nature would had been no obstacles to me. It is one of those rare games which could come at any period in history and still be good or feasible to make. It came out in 2005, but it's one of those rare cases where a brilliant game like this could had came out in 2000 too and be just the same.[/i][hr][/hr]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Calicifer/discussions/0/599648251203922700/][i]Calicifer's Reviews[/i][/url]",

But, if I'm to offer a fair review of the game, I have to admit that, yes, it IS awful. There is little in this game to justify a purchase at full price, and the game itself is.. well... frustrating. I'd like to think I had an excellent vocabulary, but there are only so many times you can make a three letter word with a burning letter before you start to feel that knowing big words is much less important than managing the tiles. It's entirely acceptable to make the word \"crepuscule\", for example, and feel high and mighty, but you'll quickly realise that the diamond tile you just earned means little now its surrounded by a ring of \"X\" tiles, with the nearest vowel located exactly 3 rounds in the past. When I was a kid, there was nothing more exciting than fighting the burning tiles (I had a sheltered childhood), and it was an amazing game in its day. But today is not that day.",

There are only two game modes - classic and action.  These modes are essentially the same with red tiles that burn through your stack just coming faster in action mode.\n\nThe 'Hall of Fame' I saw only had a few pre-installed scores and there was no online leaderboard action going on.\n\nOnce I'd had a play around with all of those things there was nothing else to do, and I found myself quickly bored.\n\nIf you want a single player version of Bookworm then I recommend the Bookworm Adventures series instead.",

Ayrıca United Offensive aksine, bu oyunda biraz daha başı sonu olan, farklı mekanlarda biraz daha detaylı görevler yerine, ilk CoD da olan, senaryolar mantığına dönmüşler. Yeni aslında hikayeden daha çok savaşta isim etmiş noktaları bir askerin gözünden deneyimliyor.Genellikle yaptığımız, bölgeleri ele geçirmek, tankları vs patlatmak ve alanı savunmak. Bu yönde oyun United Offensivein gerisinde kalmış diyebilirim.\r\n\r\nOynanış tarafında ise, oyun tarihinde ilk kez oyun bizleri iki soluklandığımızda canımızın dolduğu mekanik ile tanıştırıyor, en azından ben ilk bu oyunda görmüştüm. Bu mekanik ile ilk oyunlara nazaran oyunun zorluğu biraz daha kolaylaşmış, çünkü yere yatıp biraz bekleyip devam edebiliyorsunuz, can paketi arama derdiniz kalmıyor. Ancak yine en zoru kesinlikle önermiyorum, yorucu.\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3551626613\r\nUnited Offensive den 1 sene sonra çıkmasına rağmen teknik sorunların giderildiği bir oyun olmuş. 2025 senesinde güncel sistemlerde bile oyunu açıp, çözünürlüğünüzü ayarlayıp ekstra bişey yapmadan canavar gibi oynayabiliyorsunuz. Bu açıdan da başarılı.\r\n\r\nGenel olarak savaş atmosferi, sesler artırılmış. Tüm oyun boyunca durmaksızın canhıraş bir çığlık, bir savaş, bir bağırma sesi mevcut. Gerçek savaşta olması gerektiği gibi.\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3551626416\r\nAyrıca oyunu oynarken ara ara gelen, \"ulan insanalr gerçekten bu senaryoları yaşadı be\" hissi de cabası. \r\n\r\n[h1]  Görsellik & Oyun Süresi  [/h1]   \r\n\r\nGörsellik  olarak 20 senelik olmasına rağmen oyun hiç rahatsız etmiyor. Teknik taraftaki sorunlarda olmadığı için çok rahat açıp oynayabiliyorsunuz. Sesler, seslendirme, ortam atmosferi oldukça başarılı.\r\n\r\nHikayeyi bitirmek 4-5 saat sürüyor. Zorlarsanız aktif MP oynayabileceğiniz yerler mutlaka bulursunuz.\r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaldorein/screenshots/?appid=2630&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall] Ekran görüntüleri için burdan. [/url]\r\n\r\n[h1] Artılar [/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n\t[*] Teknik sorunlardan arındırılmış olması\r\n\t[*] Çok iyi savaş atmosferi, seslendirmeler\r\n\t[*] Eski durmayan, rahatsız etmeyen görsellik\r\n\t[*] Keyifli hikaye modu \r\n\t\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1] Eksiler[/h1]\r\n[list]   \r\n\t[*] United Offensive sonrası senaryolar basite indirgenmiş\r\n\t[*] Temel görev döngüsü tüm senaryolarda aynı \r\n[/list]\r\n \r\n[h1]ÇIKTIĞI DÖNEM PUANI: 90 / 100[/h1]\r\n[h1]GÜNÜMÜZ PUANI: 75 / 100[/h1]\r\n\r\n[h1] Kapanış [/h1]\r\n\r\nSerinin efsaneleşmeye başladığı, multiplayerı hala oynanan müthiş bir oyun. Seriyi oynuyorsanız mutlaka şans verin. Sırada oyun tarihinin en iyi FPSlerinden olan Cod4 var!\r\n\r\nİyi oyunlar!\r\n",
